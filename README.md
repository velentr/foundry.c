# Datastructures

Code for reusable data structures in C. The end goal of this repo is to have
some commonly used, well-tested, and well-documented data structures for use in
C. I have elected to write fast, efficient implementations, rather than trying
to catch any errors made from improper use of the interface.

Right now, all needed documentation is inside the header files for each
data structure (I'll probably organize this better later).

Currently, I have completed and tested the following data structures:

 - vector : Dynamically-resizable arrays, similar to the vectors in STL.
