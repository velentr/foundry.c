# Foundry.c

Reusable code for various data structures and algorithms in C. This repo is
intended to give C programmers a library of generic data structures and
algorithms that can be reused across projects, similar to STL.

## Data Structures

The following data structures have been written:

 - `vector` : Dynamically-resizable arrays.
 - `binheap` : Binary min-heap, implemented using a vector.
 - `list` : Doubly-linked list without any dynamic memory allocation.
